In the MVC pattern, the manipulation of data and the coordination of actions between the View and 
the Model are typically handled by the Controller. The Controller receives user input from the View,
updates the Model accordingly, and may also update the View to reflect changes in the Model.

Model (Manages Data and Business Logic):

    Holds the state of the application.
    Performs calculations, updates data, and enforces business rules.
    Provides methods to query or modify the state.

View (Displays Information):

    Displays the current state of the Model to the user.
    Sends user input to the Controller.
    Should not contain application state or business logic.
    Controller (Handles User Input and Coordinates Actions):

    Listens to user input from the View.
    Updates the Model based on user input.
    May update the View to reflect changes in the Model.
    In your case, the Controller should handle tasks like updating the paddle position, 
    managing game physics, handling key events, initiating game saves, loading games, 
    and controlling the flow of the game. It should delegate specific tasks to the Model 
    when it comes to manipulating data or applying game logic.

Here are examples of tasks that might belong in the Controller:

    Handling key events (handle(KeyEvent event) method).
    Initiating game saves and loads (saveGame(), loadGame() methods).
    Controlling game flow (starting, stopping, restarting the game).
    Managing game physics and collisions.
    Updating the Model based on user input.
    The division of responsibilities helps keep your code organized, 
    modular, and easier to maintain. It also supports the concept of separation of concerns, 
    making each component focused on a specific aspect of the application.

NOTE: ask later about what ss is needed for git - show an example?
**Game Instructions:**
- choco block gives +3 score
- heart block gives lives
- gold star block -> gold ball -> freezes lives for _ seconds
- s -> saves game

**Compilation Instructions:**

**Features Implemented and Working Properly:**
1. Game Icon added
2. Window size is now fixed (does not extend to full screen).
3. Exit button added - closes window and exits program.
4. About button - has how to play instructions.
5. Separate start screen with game menu implemented.
6. Invert bonus - (A feature from the original Brick Breaker game) 
   If ball touches a dark-blue pixel block, it releases an invert bonus. If the paddle touches this bonus, 
   the paddle's controls reverse. If paddle's controls were already reversed, catching the bonus 
   again will reverse the paddle controls back to normal.
7. Short Paddle bonus - (the original Brick Breaker game had a feature that elongates the paddle, I have decided to
   implement the opposite to make the game harder)
   if the ball touches the dark-purple pixel block, it releases a short paddle bonus. 
   If paddle touches this bonus, the paddle shortens. If the paddle is already shortened catching the bonus again
   will reverse the bonus (paddle becomes old size again)
8. Pause feature implemented - press space bar to pause the game, and press space bar again to resume the game.

**Features Implemented but Not Working Properly:**

**Features Not Implemented(Yet):**
1. New bonus power - laser shooting to bricks to break them


**New Java Classes:**

- GameButton Class
  - It inherits from the existing Button class.
  - Its purpose is to:
    - store the image file name for the button
    - set the image to the button
    - set the height of the button
    - preserve the ratio of height and width of image
    - sets the background color of the button
    - sets the X and Y coordinates of the button
  - Reason why class was created:
    - To replace the repetitive blocks of code for each button's graphic settings in the start() function of
      the Main class, and the buttons in showWin and showGameOver().
    - Provides a convenient way to create buttons with associated images, coordinates, and styles for the application. 
      It encapsulates the common functionality required for creating game buttons in this game, reducing redundancy 
      and promoting code reuseability.

- View Class
  - It holds all the functions which were in the Main class, that were related to modifying the UI.
  - Its purpose is to:
    - 
  - Reasons why this class was created:
    - The Main class violates the Single-Class-Single-Responsibility Principle. This is because the modification of the
      UI, game logic, and storage of data was all executed in a single class. As a solution, I implemented the MVC
      pattern and therefore the View class was created.
    - This class handles the changes in the UI, like changing teh game background, initializing the labels for display,
      setting visibility of the objects, and filling in images for the objects.
    - This class was made as a singleton class as only one View object is required for the game, and this centralizes
      the configuration of the View class and prevents duplication of resources.
- Model Class
  - A singleton class which holds all the variables and functions relating to the game state and logic.
  - Its purpose is to:
    - 
  - Reasons why this class was created:
    -  single point of access to the game state from various parts of your application
    -  centralizes the game state, making it easier to manage and modify. Particularly useful since multiple components
       need to interact with or modify the game state.
    - ensures that there is only one instance of the game state, preventing issues related to multiple instances 
      having different states.


**Modified Java Classes:**
Note: Any Runnable() functions and EventHandler<ActionEvent>() in all classes were replaced with lambda expressions.
- Main Class 
    - isGoldStauts renamed as isGoldStatus, sceneHeigt renamed as sceneHeight, and variables and functions with the word
      colide in it was renamed to collide for clarity.
    - getter methods for sceneWidth and sceneHeight included because in Score class, the labels for messages are to be 
      centered, therefore scene dimensions are needed.
    - paddleWidth is not final as it is changed according to the shortPaddle bonus.
      Setter method for paddleWidth added.
    - new scene for the "how to play" page was introduced.
    - new flag variable invert introduced to inform other functions if paddle touches the invert bonus.
    - new flag variable startGame was introduced so that the functions loadGame and nextLevel do not set the 
      visibility of the game buttons to true when moving to the next level or when starting a loaded game.
    - variables related to the paddle (xBreak, yBreak, breakWidth, etc ) were changed to include the word 'paddle' 
      instead (eg. xPaddle, yPaddle, paddleWidth, etc) as the word 'break' was ambiguous.
    - start function was modified to add a new scene for How To Play, to restrict window size (window should not enlarge),
      to add a game icon.
    - chocos array renamed as bonusArray - the name chocos can easily be mistaken as storing the choco blocks.
    - choco was also renamed as bonus1, as new bonuses are to be introduced.
    - Unused variables like v and oldXBreak were removed.
    - vX and vY control the speed of the ball (both stored 1). The speed value was doubled. (Now they both store 2 and 
      2.5 respectively)
    - for the buttons, a class GameButton was introduced to reduce the amount of duplicated code for adding images
      to the buttons. The code was refactored to adjust to the inclusion of the new class.
    - the method handle() was altered to accommodate for the new feature "pause game" using the space bar.
    - new method togglePause() was added, it alters the visibility of the "Game paused :)" label and stops and resumes
      the game engine.
    - in method handle(), the sleepTime was set to 0, because when invert bonus is caught by paddle, it causes a lag in
      inverting the controls.
  
  - methods setSavePaths() and checkforDDrive() added to set the file path for game file saving the game progress.
    checkforDDrive() method checks if the device has a DDrive.
    setSavePaths() uses the function checkforDDrive() to set the file path for save.mdd. If D drive does not exist,
    it saves the game file relative to the game directory.

  - ballRadius's scope was changed from private to public final static, as the altered method checkHitToBlock() in 
    the Block class uses ballRadius to calculate more accurate ball-block collisions

  - two methods setVisibleGameObjects() and setNotVisibleGameObjects() made to replace repetitive blocks of code
    for setting visibility of game objects. 

  - According to Bob's Concise Coding Conventions, it should be possible to see the whole method from start to finish
    without scrolling. This was not the case for methods setPhysicsToBall(), saveGame(), loadGame() and onUpdate(). 
  - Therefore they were refactored, and have helper methods introduced to make the methods more modular and easier to
    understand.
    - method setPhysicsToBall() has helper methods moveBall(), handleBallYBoundaries(), handleBallPaddleCollision(), 
      handleBallXBoundaries(), handleBallWallCollisions() and handleBallBlockCollision(). They are used to make the 
      method setPhysicsToBall() more maintainable and easy to read. Each helper method is responsible for a specific
      aspect of the ball's behavior.
    - method saveGame() has helper methods saveGameInfo(), saveBlockInfo() and closeOutputStream().
    - method loadGame() has helper methods copyGameInfo() and copyBlockInfo().
    - method onUpdate() has helper methods handleBlockHit() and handleBlockType().
  - Since the Main class violated the Single Class, Single Responsibility principle, the MVC pattern was used to
    separate the responsibilities to different classes, and the Model and View classes were created,
    variables and functions from the Main class were moved accordingly. Functions initPaddle, initBoard, initBall remain
    in the Main class as they have to be configured according to user input (like when the game is loaded, the paddle
    width may differ if player caught the short paddle bonus previously and has to be drawn differently).

  - function startEngine() added to remove duplicate blocks of code used to initialise the engine settings.

- GameEngine Class:
  - Since GameEngine is only used once in the Main class, it was converted to a singleton class. The getInstance method 
    is synchronized, which is good for ensuring that only one instance of GameEngine class is created even in a 
    multithreaded environment.
  - flag variable 'paused' introduced. Used by most threads in the GameEngine class to ensure the game is not
    paused before executing their respective instructions.
  - methods pause() and resume() added to alter the paused variable. This is later called in the Main class to 
    pause the game.

  
- Block Class
  - After doubling the speed of the ball, checkHitToBlock() was changed to increase accuracy of ball-block collisions.
    The old checkHitToBlock() method checked for exact positions of the ball relative to the block, and the ball
    sometimes moved behind the blocks. It was not robust enough to handle higher speeds. The new altered version of the
    method allows for a range of positions to be considered as hits and adjusts well to the new speed of the ball.
  - new block type called BLOCK_INVERT introduced - when hit by ball, gives the bonus of reversing the controls of 
    the paddle (when left arrow pressed, moves right, and vice versa.)
  - new block type called BLOCK_SHORT was introduced - when hit by the ball, gives the bonus of shortening the paddle.

- LoadSave Class
  - According to Bob's Concise Coding Conventions, it should be possible to see the whole method from start to finish,
    without scrolling. The read() method is too big to fit in a screen, therefore helper methods loadGameStats(),
    loadGameObjs() and loadGameFlags() were introduced to make the loading process more modular and easy-to-read.

- Bonus Class was renamed to Power (there are negative and positive powers, therefore the word bonus was not appropriate)
  - new variable powerType to identify the type of power - eg: +3, invert, short paddle etc.
  - powerType added as parameter to constructor.
  - using powerType to identify type of power, the image is added to the power in the draw() function.
    
- Score Class
  - showWin() method altered to include a back button to navigate back to start menu after game is won.

  
**Unexpected Problems:**
1. java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException - happened after level 1, the blocks keep forming,
   in an endless loop, does not configure the next level. 
   - How the problem was solved:
     In the stop() function of the Game Engine class previously used .stop() to terminate the threads.
     This method is deprecated in Java as it may leave the application in an inconsistent state.
     I used .interrupt() to make the respective threads' (updateThread, timeThread and PhysicsThread)
     run() functions to throw an Interrupted Exception, and then returning from the functions to exit them.

2. When saving the game using (S), there was a FileNotFound Exception. This was due to the filepath storing in 
   the file path "D:/..." but not all devices own a D drive.
   - How the problem was solved:
     In the main() function in the class Main, right before the start() function is called, I call a function named 
     setSavePaths(). It checks if the device has a D drive and alters the variables savePath and savePathDir accordingly.
     If the device does not have a D drive, it changes the filepath to the device's C drive.

3. Load button was present in the game code but did not appear in the game screen.
   - How the problem was solved:
     load button added to root for the first scene added to primaryStage. The load button functioned as expected.

4. If there was no saved game progress and "load game" button is pressed, the paddle moves to the top left of the screen
   and ball moves abnormally.
   - How the problem was solved:
     There is game progress saved only if the save.mdd file exists. Therefore, I altered the setOnAction function for the 
     load button to check if the save.mdd file exists. If it does, the file is read to resume that game, else
     the label "No previous games saved :<" appears.

5. Labels keep freezing on screen.
   - How the problem was solved:
     Thread.sleep(15) for animations is not the most efficient way to achieve animations on JavaFX, therefore I used 
     a built-in animation framework for smoother animations. Instead of manually updating the scale/position of the 
     label with a for loop to make animations with threading, I utilized TranslateTransition for movement and 
     FadeTransition for fading.

6. Exception in thread "JavaFX Application Thread" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException - occurs when iterating
   over the collections blocks and bonusArray and making changes to the collections during iteration.
   - How the problem was solved:
     The ArrayLists blocks and bonusArray are declared as normal collections, which are not thread-safe and can
     cause problems if they are modified while they are being iterated over. Therefore, I declared both arrays as
     concurrent collections of type CopyOnWriteArrayList. This means that it is safe to modify the collections
     while you are iterating over it, so you will not get a ConcurrentModificationException.

7. when the player loses all their lives, when Game Over is displayed, the hearts label is not updated to 0, remains at
   old value.
   - How problem was solved:
     - In function handleBallYBoundaries(), in the if statement that confirms that the game is over, the program was
       altered to call the function onUpdate() for the last time to update the game screen before the game engine
       halts.

8. When playing a loaded game, after all bricks are broken, sometimes the game continues without moving to the next 
   level. 
   - How the problem was solved:
      - A logical error was present. This is because, in the read file we read the destroyedBlockCount value and the 
      blocks array stores only the blocks which have not been destroyed. If for example the player starts with 12 bricks, 
      and he breaks 7 bricks and saves the game, destroyedBlockCount stores 7, but when he reloads the game, the blocks 
      array size is now 5, as destroyed bricks are not loaded. We compare destroyedBlockCount and blocks array size (if they are equal) 
      to call nextLevel, but these values will never be the same.
      - in the function loadGameStats(), I overwrite destroyedBlockCount to 0. If destroyed blocks are not loaded into
      the game, there is no need to store the player's previous destroyedBlockCount.

9. After incorporating the short paddle bonus, if there were multiple of that same bonus being caught by the paddle
   the paddle glitches.
   - How the problem was solved:
     The code responsible for changing the paddle width was updated to use `Platform.runLater()` each time the width was
     modified. This ensured that the UI updates occurred in a thread-safe manner. After applying the solution, the game 
     was tested, and the glitch associated with frequent paddle resizing was no longer observed. The movement of the 
     paddle remained smooth and glitch-free.

10. If the game was saved while the ball was in gold form, the loaded game does not show the ball with gold ball image.
    - How the problem was solved:
      The function which frequently updated the ball's features was the moveBall() function. Therefore, I modified
      this function to check the isGoldStats flag and change the image of the ball appropriately.

**Implementation of the MVC pattern: Explanation of the separation of the original Main class code**
why is initpaddle, board and ball left in main class?
why is physics ball and onupdate functions left in the main class?
what was moved to model and view classes and why?
